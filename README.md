### Build a Web API reference application via a Java Web API application using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or AKS

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This is a Java Spring Boot Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Container Registry
- Connect to and query CosmosDB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor
- Instructions for setting up Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB are in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with permissions to create:
  - Resource Groups, Service Principals, Keyvault, CosmosDB, App Service, Azure Container Registry, Azure Monitor
- Bash shell (tested on Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work in Cloud Shell unless you have a remote dockerd
  - Will not work in WSL1
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- Java 8 above ([download](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp/)) 
- JQ ([download](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/))
- Maven ([download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))
- Completion of the Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB setup in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
  - cd to the base directory of the repo
  - All instructions assume starting from the root of the repo

### Build the container using Docker
- The unit tests run as part of the Docker build process. You can also run the unit tests manually.
- For instructions on building the container with ACR, please see the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash
# Make sure you are in the root of the repo
# Build the image - this can take 3-5 minutes

docker build -t helium-dev .

```

- Run the application locally and clean previous packages and unit tests

- The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
  - You can run the application locally by using Azure CLI cached credentials
    - You must run az login before this will work
```bash
az login

# show your Azure accounts
az account list -o table

# select the Azure account
az account set -s {subscription name or Id}

# Make sure you are in the root of the repo

export AUTH_TYPE=CLI
export KEYVAULT_NAME="YOUR_KEYVAULT_NAME"

# This command takes about 3-5 minutes:

mvn clean package 

mvn spring-boot:run

# When the previous command shows 'Netty started on port(s): 4120' 
# test the application (takes about 10 seconds to start) in a new window

curl http://localhost:4120/healthz

# Stop the application by typing Ctrl-C in the Azure CLI terminal window
# Or :::::

mvn spring-boot:stop

```

- Run the application as a local container instead

```bash

# Make sure you are in the root of the repo
# Run the command below to stop the previous instance and free up port 4120:

mvn spring-boot:stop 

# You can also hit Ctrl-C from the shell window

# Build the image and run the container using Docker 

# make sure you are in the root of the repo

# this will use Azure CLI cached credentials

# build the image

docker build -t helium-dev .

# Then run the container.  

docker run -p4120:4120 --name helium-dev --env AUTH_TYPE=CLI --env KEYVAULT_NAME=$KEYVAULT_NAME -v ~/.azure:/home/helium/.azure helium-dev:latest

# Check the logs to ensure the container is properly running
# Re-run until the application started message appears

docker logs helium-dev

# test the application
# the application takes about 10 seconds to start and you may have to run the below command more than once
curl http://localhost:4120/healthz

# Clean up  - stop and remove the container
docker stop helium-dev
docker rm helium-dev

```
